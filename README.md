# Leaflet-Challenge

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project was to create a mapped visual of recent earthquake data around the world. By creating these visuals, interested parties are able to see where earthquakes have occurred over the past 7 days. Additionally, the viewer is able to see the severity of the earthquakes based on color and size of the markers. 

## Usage

Using the same folder structure seen in this repository, run the index.html file to view the map with earthquake data.
